Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction Project, an open-source solution for predicting customer churn in businesses using the Random Forest algorithm. This project is designed to help businesses identify and mitigate customer churn, enabling them to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.
# Project Overview:
Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical concern for businesses across various industries. The Customer Churn Prediction Project utilizes machine learning and specifically the Random Forest algorithm to analyze customer data and predict the likelihood of churn. By understanding the factors contributing to customer churn, businesses can take data-driven actions to reduce attrition and improve customer retention.

# Key Features:
**Random Forest Model:** The repository contains a Random Forest machine learning model that has been trained on historical customer data. This model can predict the probability of customer churn.

**Data Preprocessing:** The project provides scripts for data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation, ensuring the data is ready for training the machine learning model.

**Jupyter Notebooks:** Explore Jupyter notebooks that offer detailed insights into model development, feature importance, evaluation, and the interpretation of results.

**Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics of the Random Forest model are presented, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

**Dataset:** The dataset used for training and evaluation is provided, allowing for transparency and reproducibility.

**User Interface:** If applicable, the project offers a user-friendly interface or integration options for using the customer churn prediction model within your business applications.
